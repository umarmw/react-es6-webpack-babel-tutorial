# Introduction

This is a simple demo application using ReactJS, webpack, ES6 and babel as transpiler.

#Synopsis

ReactJS has been taking the world of front end development by storm gaining widespread usage at many software companies. Described by its own homepage as the V in MVC, React allows you to build reusable UI components and makes maintaining changes in your dataâ€™s state effortless by abstracting the DOM. Combined with a bundler utility like Webpack, React greatly simplifies building and maintaining Single Page Applications.
